# ZipCode

This is a simple application developed in Flutter that allows the user to search for the address of a place through the zip code (Postal Address Code) entered. This application uses the `http` and `provider` packages to make a call to an address search API.

## How to use
To use the app, just follow these steps:

1. Open the app and click on the text field to enter the zip code.
2. Enter the desired zip code (numbers only).
3. Click the "Pesquisar" button to start the search.
4. The application will display the address corresponding to the zip code entered.

## Running the APP

In order to run the app, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. If you don't have it, you can follow the installation instructions at [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2.  Clone this repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/fagnerdossantos/zipcode.git`.
3.  Access the project folder with the command `cd zipcode`.
4.  Connect a mobile device or open an emulator.
5.  Run the command `flutter run` to run the application on the device or emulator.

>  The application will only work correctly if the zip code is valid and registered in the address search API.
